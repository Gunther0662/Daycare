# Sunshine Daycare

## Project Description:

This application streamlines daycare facility operations by providing real-time weather updates, navigation support, and effortless parent communication through a modal interface. Our goal is to improve user experience and operational efficiency for parents.

As daycare managers, we intend to create an interactive web application to effectively manage daycare activities and communicate with parents. This web application seeks to offer parents accessible technology, making navigation assistance, safety and weather updates, and communication alerts more convenient.
